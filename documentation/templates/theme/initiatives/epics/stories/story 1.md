# Sample Story
As a product owner, I want to document the agile project progress for the development of MyWebClass platform, so that I can track the progress of the project and ensure that the team is working towards the goal of providing an integrated learning experience that contextualizes technology with business processes to provide realistic scenarios for students to learn technology in a hands-on real world environment.
