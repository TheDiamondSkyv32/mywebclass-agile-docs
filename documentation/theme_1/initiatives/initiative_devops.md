# Initiative Title: DevOps Implementation for Automated Testing and Deployment

# Description: The goal of this initiative is to implement a DevOps process that enables automated testing to catch issues early on and adapt to changing requirements, as well as automated deployment of the current development branch to team members' local environments to facilitate manual review.

# Epics:

1. Implement automated testing framework
1. Develop a suite of automated tests for critical functionality
1. Integrate automated testing into CI/CD pipeline
1. Implement automated deployment of current development branch to local environments
1. Develop a manual review process for local environments
# Test Plan:

1. For automated testing framework:
    * Verify that the framework is compatible with all required technologies
    * Confirm that the framework is configurable and can be customized to meet project-specific requirements
    * Verify that the framework can execute test scripts in parallel and can report test results accurately
1. For automated tests:
    * Develop a test suite for critical functionality based on functional requirements
    * Verify that the test suite covers all critical functionality
    * Verify that the test suite is reliable and repeatable
1. For integration into CI/CD pipeline:
    * Verify that the automated tests can be executed as part of the pipeline
    * Verify that the pipeline can report test results and alert team members of failed tests
    * Verify that the pipeline can be triggered automatically by changes to the codebase
1. For automated deployment:
    * Verify that the deployment process can be triggered manually and automatically
    * Verify that the deployment process can deploy the current development branch to local environments
    * Verify that the deployment process can handle differences between local environments and production environments
1. For manual review process:
    * Develop a process for team members to review changes on their local environments
    * Verify that team members have access to the most recent changes in the development branch
    * Verify that team members can report issues or provide feedback easily
